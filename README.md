# Multiplayer Pong/Breakout Project

This project is an Android mobile game that combines the popular games Pong and Atari Breakout into a competitive multiplayer game. The game supports local peer-to-peer bluetooth functionality between android devices, and includes a local leaderboard as well as a variety of game features such as difficulty, power-ups, and more.

This project was originally a group project for my Processes for Object-Oriented Software Development class in Fall 2021, and this repo exists as a fork of the final version of the project that was worked on collaboratively. The original version of this project and it's co-authors can be found there.
